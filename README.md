19th Hole Stats: One Pager


A golf performance tracking and analysis web application that allows users to input their score and other relevant stats while on the golf course. The user will input the name of the course they are playing and the par score of the course as well as the par score for each hole they are on. At the end of the round the user will have their final score which will then be saved and posted to their profile for future reference.

Users would be able to view their performance over time by accessing their profile page, which would display their average score, total rounds played, and other statistics. The application may also provide visualizations of the user's performance, such as line graphs displaying trends in their scores over time or for a particular course.

The application may also allow users to compare their performance to other players. Users could search for other players by name or username, and view their profile page to see their statistics and performance data. The application could also provide a leaderboard showing the top players, sorted by their average score or other metrics.

MVP would allow players to track and record their scores throughout a round and save them to a database. From there, users would be able to retrieve past rounds played and stats from those rounds on a profile page.

Overall, this golf performance tracking and analysis application would provide users with a comprehensive tool for tracking and improving their golf game. 

By using Java, Spring Boot, React and MySQL, I want to attempt to build a robust and scalable application that could help golfers of all levels improve their performance and enjoyment of the game.
